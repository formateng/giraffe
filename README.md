# Planar Mesh Tool for Grasshopper

Copyright Â© 2012-2014 Ramboll UK Ltd.

Project started by [Harri Lewis](https://github.com/harrilewis).

## Description

Contains a Grasshopper component which implements a remeshing algorithm that approximates a mesh with planar panels.  Each panel represents a cluster of faces in the parent mesh.  Clusters can be arranged by distance or by surface normal.  Note that manual post-processing is sometimes required for complex forms.

This projcet is an implementation of processes described in [Cutler & Whiting - Constrained Planar Remeshing for Architecture][srcpap] ([abstract][srcabs]).

Includes an winged edge mesh implementation (although the plan is to replace this with [Plankton](https://github.com/Dan-Piker/Plankton)).
